# Simple-Scalar-Processor-Simulation

Simulation of instruction flow in a simple scalar processor, with Hazard Detection and computing CPI

Program's instructions and data should be filled in "ICache.txt" and "DCache.txt" files respectively both of which are 256 bytes

Then compile the main.cpp and execute.

output.txt will have information regarding hazards and updated DCache is also present in output directory.

Exact Problem Statement is in "Problem_Statement.pdf"
